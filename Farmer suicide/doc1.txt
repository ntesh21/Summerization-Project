A farmer from Rajasthan Gajendra Singh hanged himself during Aam Aamdi Party’s (AAP) rally at Jantar Mantar, Delhi and the blame game started.
The Delhi police registered a First Information Report (FIR), accusing AAP volunteers for the tragic incident.
Home Minister Rajnath Singh backed the Delhi Police, which is under fire for allegedly not doing enough to stop the suicide.
Meanwhile AAP leader Ashutosh broke down while speaking to Gajender Singh’s daughter and held himself guilty for the incident.
Amidst all this drama, the real issue of farmers’ suicide is being buried and AAP has become a scapegoat.
The Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are equally responsible for increasing rate of farmers’ suicide in the country.
AAP volunteers may have provoked Gajendra Singh for the suicide.
They may not have done enough to stop him doing so. But it’s not just about Gajendra Singh.
Out of the total of 11,772 farmers who ended their lives in India in 2013, 3,146 were from Maharashtra where Congress party had been in power for last ten years.
Andhra Pradesh is at second place, registering 2,104 farmer suicide followed by Karnataka (1,403) and Madhya Pradesh (1,090).
The four states almost account for two-thirds of farmers’ suicides in the country.
Gujarat also saw 582 farmers committing suicide in 2013, compared to 564 in 2012.
These states have been either run by Congress or the BJP. According to the figures, a total of 2,97, 056 farmers have taken their own lives in India since 1995 to 2013.
The AAP came into existence on 26 November 2012.
By politicizing the issue of Gajendra Singh’s suicide, both Congress and BJP are trying to hide their own sins.
Kejriwal, or his party workers might be responsible for the death of one farmer but lakhs of farmers lost their lives under Congress or BJP rule.
Before criticizing Kejriwal and AAP, BJP and Congress must remember that they are far more responsible for the pathetic situation of farmers in the country.
