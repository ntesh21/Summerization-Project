COAI today announced ‘Sabka Internet, Sabka Vikas’, an initiative to connect the 1 billion unconnected citizens of India. Launching the online platform www.sabkainternet.in, COAI reiterated that the Internet should be for all.  The association invited all stakeholders to have a comprehensive and informed debate on the subject of Net Neutrality to develop a framework that caters to the infrastructure and diverse socio-economic needs of the country.

The leadership team of the member companies of COAI, namely, Ashok Sharma of Aircel, Gopal Vittal of Airtel, Himanshu Kapania of Idea Cellular, Shanker Adawal of Reliance Jio, Rajiv Bawa of Telenor, Arvind Bali of Videocon, and Sunil Sood of Vodafone India, were present to reaffirm their commitment to ‘Sabka Internet, Sabka Vikas’ initiative and promote Net Equality.

Elaborating its position on the ongoing public debate over net neutrality, and concerns over operators allegedly controlling consumers’ access to the Internet, the association stated, “We support an open Internet and believe that consumers should decide what to do online. Our job is to enable consumers to benefit from that freedom. They added, “We offer choice and do not block or provide any preferential access to any web site or app.”

COAI also underlined its commitment to the Digital India drive and called for an open, inclusive and affordable access to the Internet for every Indian.

In terms of Internet penetration, India is ranked 142nd presently. Further, Internet users are expected to reach over 500 million by 2018, making India the second largest population of Internet users in the world. Hence, innovations would be required across the ecosystem that promotes greater digital inclusion; in order to achieve the Digital India dream.
