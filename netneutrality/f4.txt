National Internet Exchange of India (Nixi), a body under the IT Ministry, Friday said it strongly supports net neutrality and any move by telecom operators to selectively bundle the services will go against the basic concept of Internet.

Nixi facilitate exchange of domestic Internet traffic between the peering ISP members.

"National Internet Exchange of India as the neutral exchange in the country, strongly supports neutrality of the Internet which is the only way forward to make the Internet open, free and innovative. Any move by Telcos to bundle application or content selectively will hamper the very basic concept of Internet," Nixi said in a statement.

Amid a raging debate on net neutrality, telecom major Bharti Airtel's Airtel Zero plan and some other platforms are being seen as discriminatory moves, even as the companies have defended their respective offerings.

Facebook's Internet.org on Reliance Communications network, as also selective access to social media sites by operators like Aircel, Uninor and Tata Teleservices have also faced criticism by the proponents of the net Neutrality.

Nixi said that technological Innovation, especially from the startups will help in making available content in local languages to the Internet users all the more so with the increasing role of mobile and other social media platforms.

"Under these circumstances any dilution of the neutrality of the Internet, is expected to affect the freedom of expression, development of innovative ideas and newer applications and entrepreneurship of youngsters and startups," Nixi said.
