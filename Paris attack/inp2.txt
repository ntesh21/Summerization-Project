[Witness: They shot at us like birds
CNN iReporter Chris Morrow of San Diego was staying five minutes from Le Petit Cambodge, a Cambodian restaurant covering an event.
"I heard an explosion and pop, pop, pop, which sounded like gunfire. I instinctively grabbed my phone and started filming out of the window."

"The men were huddling around, and there was no one on the street except them. They had long shotguns and seemed hysterical, screaming and not really sure what to do.
"They tried a few apartment doors, trying to get in, but they were locked. In the end, they ran toward the river. I am not sure if they were police or the attackers."

Solidarity and fear
There has been an outpouring of support and solidarity in Paris, but large gatherings in the streets have not materialized in part because the state of emergency prohibits those.
But there's more to it than those restrictions, Paris Deputy Mayor Patrick Klugman said.
"There is more sadness and probably more fear," Klugman told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. "We don't know yet if this terror in fact is over or not. And, from time to time on social media, you have more reports -- most (of it) false news -- but it shows how worried" the population is.
In the aftermath of the attacks, Parisians helped each other out by using social media to invite those in need inside their homes.
The message spread and "all around here, people opened up the doors of their buildings of their flats to welcome people," Klugman said.
Concerns
President Barack Obama spoke to Hollande and offered him support and condolences. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security are closely monitoring the situation, but there is no credible or specific threat in the United States, a U.S. government official said.
