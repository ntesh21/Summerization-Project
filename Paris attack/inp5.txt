U.S. Senate intelligence panel chair: Paris attackers likely used encryption
The chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee said on Tuesday that it was likely that end-to-end encryption was used by individuals in Belgium, France and Syria involved in the Paris attacks last week.
Republican Senator Richard Burr also told reporters that U.S. investigators are in Paris but are "not active in the investigation." He said France has not asked for assistance from FBI explosives experts.

Turkey fans boo minute's silence for Paris victims
Turkish fans booed during the minute's silence for the victims of the Paris attacks before their national team drew 0-0 with Greece in a friendly international soccer game on Tuesday.
The mark of respect was observed at matches across Europe, including at Wembley where France faced England, after Islamic State militants struck Paris on Friday killing 129 people.
Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and Greek counterpart Alexis Tsipras watched the game together, in a sign of reconciliation between the two neighbours, whose relationship has suffered from hostilities in the past.
It was the first time the two teams had met for eight years and the Turkish Football Federation had announced a string of additional security measures before the match at the Istanbul Basaksehir stadium, which was a 17,000 sell out.
Turkey, who have not lost this year, are preparing ahead of Euro 2016, which they qualified for in third place in their group. They enjoyed a 2-1 victory away to Qatar last week.
Greece's German coach Michael Skibbe led out a team in Turkey for the first time since he had spells at Galatasaray, Eskisehirspor and Karabukspor from 2008 to October this year.
However, the occasion was a disappointment with both teams trying out new players in a game of few chances with former European champions Greece, who failed to qualify for the Euros, having just one goal attempt against Turkey's 12.

Video footage triggers search for extra assailant in Paris shootings
French investigators have determined from video footage that there were three men in a car used for the shootings at bars and restaurants in Paris on Friday and that one unidentified additional man was now being sought, two sources told Reuters.
"Three men were in the black Seat used to fire on the bar terraces and restaurants," a judicial source said.
The source said that investigators were now sure that alongside Salah Abdeslam, who is being sought by police, and his brother Brahim who blew himself up at the scene, there was a third man, whom they have yet to identify.
"He is therefore being sought," a second source close to the investigation said.

French police issue photo to identify Stade de France bomber
French police on Tuesday published a photo of a man they want to identify, saying he was one of the suicide bombers at the Stade de France soccer stadium in Paris on Friday.
A judicial official confirmed the photo was the man suspected of having been registered in Greece, but while investigators were leaning towards the passport being real, they did not think it belonged to the suicide bomber.
After the series of attacks in Paris on Friday in which at least 129 people died, a Syrian passport was found next to the dead body of one of three suicide bombers who detonated their belts and died at the stadium.
The passport carried the name of Ahmad Al Mohammad, born on Sept. 10 1990 from Idlib, in northwest Syria.
The French prosecutor's office said at the time that the passport was being checked as to whether it belonged to the dead man, but they said the body's fingerprints matched with print of a person registered under that name in Greece in October 2015.

France launches 3rd night of air strikes on Islamic State in Raqqa
France's defence minister said 10 warplanes were targeting Islamic State's Syrian stronghold of Raqqa for the third consecutive day on Tuesday and vowed that the campaign against the group would intensify in the coming days.
"At this moment, our air force ... 10 fighter jets are again hitting Raqqa, and as you know tomorrow the aircraft carrier Charles De Gaulle will leave for the eastern Mediterranean to continue strikes on specific targets in particular around Raqqa and Deir ez-Zour," Jean-Yves Le Drian told TF1 tv channel.
He added that he believed Russia's position was shifting since confirmation that a tourist plane full of Russians was blown up by Islamic State over the Sinai last month.
"Russia is shifting because today Russian cruise missiles hit Raqqa. Maybe today this grand coalition with Russia is possible because it has evolved," he said, referring to President Francois Hollande's call to create a large coalition against the group.

UPDATE: Soccer-Germany v Netherlands friendly called off-police
A friendly soccer game between hosts Germany and Netherlands in Hanover was called off less than two hours before its start on Tuesday, German police said.
Spectators already inside the stadium were asked to leave, a police spokesman and a Lower Saxony interior ministry official said.
They gave no reason for the cancellation of the game, just four days after the deadly attacks in Paris. German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been set to attend along with other government ministers in a show of solidarity with France.
Two Dutch government ministers attending the match – Defence Minister Jeanine Hennes and Health and Sport Minister Edith Schippers — were on their way to the airport to return home.
The world champions had initially not wanted the game to go ahead after having played against France in Paris on Friday as a wave of attacks hit the city, killing 129 people.
The contingent of 80 Germans, including players, coaches and staff, then spent the night holed up in the changing rooms of the Stade de France stadium as the attacks took place across the capital, before leaving straight for the airport on Saturday morning.
But the players, coaches as well as the national football association then decided to go ahead with the game in a show of unity with the French.

Belgian suspects checked three times returning from France- lawyer
French police pulled over three times a car carrying three Belgium-based men suspected of involvement in Friday's attacks in Paris when they were returning from the French capital the following morning, the lawyer of one of them told Belgian media.
Xavier Carette, who is representing the owner of a Volkswagen Golf car that drove back from Paris, told Belgian broadcaster RTBF on Tuesday that his client was in Brussels when he received a call from a friend, Salah Abdeslam, two hours after the attacks on Friday night.
Abdeslam, whose brother Brahim blew himself up in the French capital and for whom an international arrest warrant has since been issued, told Mohamed Amri, 27, he had broken down in Paris and needed a lift back.
The car, carrying Abdeslam, Amri, and a third man named by local media as Hamza Attou, 21, back to Belgium was pulled over three times by French police, the last time at just after 9 a.m. close to the Belgian border, Carette, who represents Amri, said.
While Abdeslam remains on the run, Belgian police have arrested the two others. Both are being held in Belgium on suspicion of leading a terrorist attack and taking part in the activities of a terrorist organisation.
Carette said that, according to Amri, none of the men had discussed the Paris attacks in which 129 people had been killed.
"You know, during the course of a car journey, you can talk about everything and nothing, listen to music, even smoke a joint, but at no time, No, they didn't talk about that," he said.

Frenchman identified in Islamic State audio claim of Paris attacks
The voice of a jihadist claiming Islamic State's responsibility for last week's attacks in Paris has been identified as a 36 year-old Frenchmen authorities believe is now in Syria, a source close to the investigation said on Tuesday.
The man, Fabien Clain from Toulouse, reads out a pre-written statement already published earlier this week claiming the attacks that killed 129 people and injured more than 350.
Half of the six-minute audio includes a man giving a rallying cry with music in the background calling for Muslims to "move forward" to fight the infidels "without ever capitulating," according to the audio sent to Reuters.
Daily newspaper Le Monde, citing sources, said Clain was suspected of orchestrating a foiled attack on at least one French church in April and said he was a close friend of al-Qaeda inspired gunman Mohammed Merah, who killed seven people in March 2012.
It added that he was sentenced to five years in prison in 2009 for having led a recruitment network to send jihadis to Iraq and left France after his release.
