[35] A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged just 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at home and scored 100 not out in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket.

[88] The first Test match between India and Pakistan in Eden Gardens was previously scheduled as the third Test match of the tournament but later on was shifted to the first match.

He scored 583 runs at an average of 67.77, and was the sixth highest run-scorer overall [51] He also made an unbeaten century in the Irani Trophy match against Delhi at the start of the 1989–90 season, playing for the Rest of India.

He made just 15 runs, being bowled by Waqar Younis , who also made his debut in that match, but was noted for how he handled numerous blows to his body at the hands of the Pakistani pace attack.

He was handpicked to play for the team by the then Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar after watching him easily negotiating India's best fast bowler at the time, Kapil Dev , in the Wankhede Stadium nets, [1] where the Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team .

[84] The Test match success was followed by two consecutive centuries in April 1998 in a Triangular cricket tournament in Sharjah – the first in a must-win game to take India to the finals and then again in the finals, both against Australia tormenting Shane Warne once again.

[66] In all, he scored 215 runs at an average of 35.83 in the Test series, and was dismissed without scoring a run in the only One Day International (ODI) he played.

In the historic Test against Pakistan at Chepauk in 1999, the first of a two-Test series, Sachin scored 136 in the fourth innings with India chasing 271 for victory.

[91] India did not progress to the final, which was won by Pakistan, and refused to participate the next time the championship was held due to increasing political tensions between India and Pakistan.

[39] [40] [41] In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the MRF Pace Foundation in Madras (now Chennai ) to train as a fast bowler , but Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee , who took a world record 355 Test wickets, was unimpressed, suggesting that Tendulkar focus on his batting instead.

His first double century (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the visiting Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in 1998.

[43] A couple of months later, former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar gave him a pair of his own ultra light pads and consoled him to not get disheartened for not getting the Bombay Cricket Association's "Best junior cricket award" (He was 14 years that time).

[1] [Note 1] Selected for Yorkshire as a replacement for the injured Australian fast bowler Craig McDermott , Tendulkar played 16 first-class matches for the county and scored 1070 runs at an average of 46.52.

On 14 November 1987, Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy , India's premier domestic First-class cricket tournament, for the 1987–88 season.

This was the beginning of a period at the top of the batting world, culminating in the Australian tour of India in early 1998, with Tendulkar scoring three consecutive centuries.
